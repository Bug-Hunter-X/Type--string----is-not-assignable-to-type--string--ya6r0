This bug demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The `greeter` function expects a string argument, but the `user` variable is an array of strings.  This results in a type error because TypeScript's type system prevents assigning an array to a string variable.

The solution demonstrates how to properly handle this by either iterating over the array and calling the function multiple times or by changing the function's signature to accept an array.
